#### Summary of the Project
- Advertising companies want to maximize revenue per dollar spent on targeted advertising campaigns.
- Two Important Features:
  - Size of Wallet (SOW): An estimate of a household's disposable income.
  - Local Affluence Code (LAC): A measure of neighborhood affluence based on housing prices and other factors.
  - These features map to the Targeted Advertising Code Assignment (TACA), which indicates whether a targeted advertising campaign is likely to have a positive (1) or negative (0) return.
