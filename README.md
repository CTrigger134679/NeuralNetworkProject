### Goals
- [ ] Complete the `Single Perceptron Training`
- [ ] Complete the `Module-7 Inspired Neural Network Training`
- [ ] Complete Optimization of threshold
- [ ] Complete Report
  - [ ] PlaceHolder

### BreakDown/Goals
- Train the network using the odd-numbered data points and the online training technique with 30 cycles
- Optimize the trained networks by determining the best threshold for mapping the output to 0 or 1, and evaluate the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs).
- Test the networks using the even-numbered data points to determine the actual ROCS.
- Write a report documenting the network designs, computational performance, analysis, and suggestions for improvement, following the provided guidelines and grading criteria.
#### Summary of the Project
- Advertising companies want to maximize revenue per dollar spent on targeted advertising campaigns.
- Two Important Features:
  - Size of Wallet (SOW): An estimate of a household's disposable income.
  - Local Affluence Code (LAC): A measure of neighborhood affluence based on housing prices and other factors.
  - These features map to the Targeted Advertising Code Assignment (TACA), which indicates whether a targeted advertising campaign is likely to have a positive (1) or negative (0) return.
